ts \


is a superset of js. it can do all of js, but more.

doesn't add more features...just allows you to write js in na more precise way so you have fewer errors

ts is compiled into js

strange issue RE linting? 

TS provides type safety: wont allow loosely typed?

i.e. 2 + '2' = 22

null + 2= 2

undef. + 2 = NaN

static checking - that's the only job ts does. a lot of langs have this, but not js. your IDE won't tell you when something's wrong (but whta about linting?)

ts analyzes code as we type

ts you write a lot more compared w/ js...but less error prone

write all code in TS - transpiled into js (don't worry about specs of what transpiled is)

ts is a dev tool. project still runs in JS\

TS gives you additional linting than otherwise. i.e. "cannot read property of undefined" etc. is avoided by linting.

but it still seems to allow for mixed typing? i.e. 2 + '2' = 22
